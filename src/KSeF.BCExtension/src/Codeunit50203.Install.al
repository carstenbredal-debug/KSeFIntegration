    // install context, so it doesn't depend on the user having the KSeF Admin permission set.
    //
    // Only NON-SECRET, environment-safe values are seeded here: the automatic default + a safe (non-prod)
    // test environment. Connection secrets (Azure Function Key) and tenant-specific values (Company NIP,
    // Azure Function URL) are intentionally NOT seeded — configure those once on the KSeF Setup page.

    // seed can read/write the setup without the user holding the KSeF Admin permission set.)
